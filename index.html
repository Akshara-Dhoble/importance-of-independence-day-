 <p style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: green; font-size: larger;">75th Independence Day: History, Significance, and Facts: After lot many years of struggle, India got its freedom from the British on August 15, 1947.<br> This year, the nation completes 75 years of Independence. Under the Centre's 'Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav' initiative,<br> a large number of events have been organised across the country to celebrate the occasion. The day will also be celebrated by Indians across the globe <br> with a lot of enthusiasm.

    Notably, it was on July 4, 1947, that the Indian Independence Day Bill was introduced <br> in the British House of Commons, which was cleared within a fortnight. Finally, on August 15, 1947, <br> India became a free country. However, it came with a huge cost with Pakistan being carved out as a separate nation.
    
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:blue; font-size: larger;">After the independence improvement of India : <br> During the post-Independence era, the growth rate nudged about 2.6 percent per annum. Expansion of farming areas and the introduction of high-yielding varieties of crops were the major factors <br>
       of growth in agricultural production. The sector could manage to end its dependency <br> on imported food grains.</p>
